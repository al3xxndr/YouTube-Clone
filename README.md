# YouTube-Clone

This is a YouTube UI Clone using HTML and CSS.

I used several techniques to solve similar isues. You'll find that to be true with using links and buttons. 
The goal here is to get some foundational knowledge with HTML and CSS and to encounter problems and learn how to solve them without help.
I reccommend just focusing on HTML and CSS at first and getting comftorable with it before moving on to JS.

You can use this code to guage your project but try not to just copy and paste because you learn better by doing.
Anyway hope you enjoy learning with this project!

DISCLAIMER 
I used images I found randomly on google and youtube for this project. 
Content credit goes to those creators.
I also mix and matched images from different users as it was just rather fun to expermiment with the UI.
